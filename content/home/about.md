# Project Description


In this project, we worked on automatic, corpus-based methods for detecting semantic change and lexical replacement for Swedish and English. The project was the first of its kind. We investigated some of the fundamental questions of *how*, *when*, and *why* languages change to allow us to quantify language change and shift lexical typological research from small case studies done on limited data sets to larger scales and over wider time spans using various media types and sources.

The team involved in the project has changed over time, the original members <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/">Richard Johansson</a>, <a href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/suve6978-1.184085">Susanne Vejdemo</a> and <a href="http://researchdatabase.su.se/converis/portal/Person/286153">Maria Koptjevskaja Tamm</a> were strengthened by <a href="https://hengchen.net/">Simon Hengchen</a>, <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Schlechtweg/">Dominik Schlechtweg</a>, and <a href="https://www.gu.se/om-universitetet/hitta-person/pierluigicassotti">Pierluigi Cassotti</a> over the course of the project. We have also had several software engineers and invited guest researchers. 

During this project, we started up the LChange workshop series, from its first resounding success in <a href="https://languagechange.org/events/2019-acl-lcworkshop/">LChange'19</a> to its follow-ups <a href="https://languagechange.org/events/2021-acl-lchange/">LChange'21</a>, <a href="https://languagechange.org/events/2022-acl-lchange/">LChange'22</a> and <a href="https://www.changeiskey.org/event/2023-emnlp-lchange/">LChange'23</a>. The series will remain long after the closing of this project. We have also participated in the first ever shared task on lexical semantic change, SemEval2020 Task 1 on <a href="http://languagechange.org/events/2020-semeval-2020-task1/">Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection</a>. There have been multiple outcomes relating to this work, including several manually annotated datasets: the <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/resources/experiment-data/wugs/">largest resource of graded contextualized, diachronic word meaning</a>, in particular on <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7389506">Swedish</a> and a paper describing the resources at <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.567/">EMNLP'21</a>. Since our task at SemEval2020, there has been many follow-ups, including for Italian, Russian, Spanish, Norwegian, and Chinese. We published the first book on <a href="https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/303">Computational approaches to semantic change</a> and the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5040302/files/303-TahmasebiEtAl-2021-1.pdf">first major survey in the field of LSC</a>. We have also written book chapters to be included in the Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics and The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Diachronic Linguistics. As a part of our work, we contributed to the development of the <a href="https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/resources/tools/durel-annotation-tool/">DURel Annotation Tool</a> used for annotating sentence pairs (in graded Word-In-Context-style), to form sense clusters of a word and to visualize them over time.  This can reveal lexical properties such as polysemy, vagueness or change of meaning of a word and is crucial for our continued study of semantic change. 


This project led to a large research program, <a href="https://www.changeiskey.org/">Change is Key!</a> around computational semantic change for the humanities and social sciences funded by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond. The program spans six years starting in 2022 with a total of 17 researchers, a research engineer and six partner universities. It is a true testament of the progress that was made during this project. 

The project was funded 2019--2022, and got extended due to Covid-19. Early 2024, we will finally close the project and thus stop updating this webpage. 
We thank our funders, the <a href="https://www.vr.se/">Swedish Research Council</a> for funding us under project number 2018-01184.
