  This second workshop on computational detection of language change is held in conjunction with SLTC 2020, and will be given completely online. It is aimed as a smaller, Swedish version of the LChange workshop series, but has drawn international attention. 
  
  The keynotes are extremely interesting and are given by Dominik Schlechtweg, IMS Stuttgart, on *Sparse Usage Graphs as Model for Word Meaning in Context*, and by Stellan Petersson & Emma Sköldberg, University of Gothenburg on *Lexical Semantics and Semantic Change - a Report from the Lexicographer's Shop Floor*.
