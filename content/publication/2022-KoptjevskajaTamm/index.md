abstract = "The chapter compares the temperature adjectives ('hot', 'cold' etc.) across Slavic against a broader typological background. The comparison targets both the systems as a whole and the forms involved in them. The main questions are how (dis)similar the temperature systems of closely related languages can be, and what is stable vs. changeable in the temperature terms of closely related languages. Slavic languages show substantial cross-linguistic variation in their systems (ranging from two to four main temperature values), while on the whole confirming several earlier tentative generalizations in Koptjevskaja-Tamm (2015). The temperature terms themselves differ in stability, both in meaning and in form (with 'warm' being the most stable term on both counts), even though most of them are traceable to proto-Slavic and even to proto-Indo-European.
