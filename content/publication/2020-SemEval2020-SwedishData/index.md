abstract = "This data collection contains the Swedish test data for SemEval 2020 Task 1: Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection. It consists of a Swedish text corpus pair (`corpus1/`, `corpus2/`) and 31 lemmas which have been annotated for their lexical semantic change between the two corpora (`targets.txt`). We sample from the KubHist2 corpus, digitized by the National Library of Sweden, and available through the Spr√•kbanken corpus infrastructure Korp (Borin et al., 2012). The full corpus is available through a CC BY (attribution) license. Each word for which the lemmatizer in the Korp pipelien has found a lemma is replaced with the lemma. In cases where the lemmatizer cannot find a lemma, we leave the word as is (i.e., unlemmatized, no lower-casing). KubHist contains very frequent OCR errors, especially for the older data.More detail about the properties and quality of the Kubhist corpus can be found in (Adesam et al., 2019)."
