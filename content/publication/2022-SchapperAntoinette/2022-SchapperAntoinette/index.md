abstract = "In recent years, the lexicon has become increasingly popular as a subject for cross-linguistic study. Although there is some debate around the exact meaning, ‘lexical typology’ – as it has come to be known – is, at its broadest, the systematic study of cross-linguistic variation in words and vocabularies (cf. Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2008; Koptjevskaja-Tamm et al. 2016). This special issue will treat lexico-semantic phenomena showing parallels across languages and address how these similarities may be described and accounted for – by universal tendencies, genetic relations among the languages, their contacts and/or their common extra-linguistic surrounding. Morphosyntactic and phonological features are regularly used by linguists to establish the existence of linguistic areas and construct areally based typologies. By contrast, lexico-semantic phenomena have, with a few exceptions (e.g., Brown 2011; Enfield 2003; Matisoff 2004; Smith-Stark 1994; Sobolev 2001), received remarkably little attention from areal linguistics and areal typology, and little is known about the geographical variation they display. Matisoff (2004), Vanhove (2008), Zalizniak et al. (2012) and Urban (2012) give numerous examples of cross-linguistically recurrent patterns of polysemy; whilst some are found the world over, others are clearly areally restricted and witnesses of language contact."
