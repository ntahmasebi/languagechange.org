abstract = "State-of-the-art models of lexical semantic change detection suffer from noise stemming from vector space alignment. We  have  empirically  tested  the *Temporal Referencing* method  for  lexical  semantic  change and show that, by avoiding alignment, it is less affected by this noise. We show that, trained on a diachronic corpus, the skip-gram with negative sampling architecture with temporal referencing  outperforms alignment models on a synthetic task as well as a manual testset. We introduce a principled way to simulate lexical semantic change and systematically control for possible biases."
