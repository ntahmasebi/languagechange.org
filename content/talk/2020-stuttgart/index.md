abstract = "In this talk I will give an overview of the work done in computational detection of semantic change over the past decade. I will present semantic change, and the impact it has on research in e.g., digital humanities. I will talk about the challenges of detecting as well as evaluating lexical semantic change, and how the newest models are in fact very similar to the oldest ones."
