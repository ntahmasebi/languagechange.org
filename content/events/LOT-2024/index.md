Nina Tahmasebi (University of Gothenburg), together with Haim Dubossarsky, Pierluigi Cassotti, and Francesco Periti will be teaching a course on Computational modeling of semantic change. 

During the LOT Winter School two types of courses are on offer: 1. RM1 courses specifically designed for first-year Research Master (RM) students, and 2. Regular courses, which are open to second-year RM students and PhD students. The RM1 courses will only be given in week 1 (January 8-12). Regular courses will be given in both weeks.

The programme offers a wide variety of relevant topics in linguistics, taught by national and international researchers. The levels of the courses range from introductory (RM1 courses) to intermediate and advanced (regular courses).

In addition to the courses, there will be Research Discussion Groups (RDGs) just for PhD students.
