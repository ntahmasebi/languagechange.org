abstract = "In this talk, Nina Tahmasebi and Simon Hengchen will first introduce different classes of methods for computationally detecting semantic change, ranging from topic modelling to contextual embeddings, and discuss how the results should be valued and evaluated. The talk will further shed light on research questions from the humanities and social science focus domains that will be tackled in Change is Key! as well as present a case-study on semantic change in Dutch-language historical newspapers using topic modelling. The event is free but registration is mandatory."
