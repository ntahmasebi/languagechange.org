    abstract = "Recent studies suggested that language models are efficient tools for measuring lexical semantic change. In our paper, we present the compilation of the first graph-based evaluation dataset for lexical semantic change in the context of the Chinese language, specifically covering the periods of pre- and post- Reform and Opening Up. Exploiting the existing framework DURel, we collect over 61,000 human semantic relatedness judgments for 40 targets. The inferred word usage graphs and semantic change scores provide a basis for visualization and evaluation of semantic change.",
