The increasing availability of large diachronic corpora and advance in computational semantics have accelerated the development of computational approaches to detecting such shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tracing the evolution of word meaning over time. Our analysis focuses on gradual changes in word semantics and relies on an incremental approach to semantic shift detection (SSD) called WiDiD. WiDiD leverages scalable and evolutionary clustering of contextualised word embeddings to detect semantic shifts and capture temporal transactions in word meanings. Existing approaches to SSD (a) significantly simplify the semantic shift problem to cover change between two (or a few) time points, and (b) consider the existing corpora as static. We instead treat SSD as an organic process in which word meanings evolve across tens or even hundreds of time periods as the corpus is progressively made available. This results in an extremely demanding task that entails a multitude of intricate decisions. We demonstrate the applicability of this incremental approach on a diachronic corpus of Italian parliamentary speeches spanning eighteen distinct time periods. We also evaluate its performance on seven popular labelled benchmarks for SSD across multiple languages. Empirical results show that our results are at least comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, while outperforming the state-of-the-art for certain languages.","tags":[],"title":"Incremental Semantic Shift Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nina Tahmasebi","Haim Dubossarsky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687384800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687384800,"objectID":"b69378b7675a4897b86489907d932def","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/publication/2023-rhhl-bookchapter/","publishdate":"2023-06-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-rhhl-bookchapter/","section":"publication","summary":"In this chapter we provide an overview of computational modeling for semantic change using large and semi-large textual corpora.

This year, LChange will feature a shared task on semantic change detection for Spanish as one track of the workshop. We hope to make this third edition another resounding success!\nThe call for papers will be similar to last time: all aspects around computational approaches to historical language change with the focus on digital text corpora. If you have published in the field previously, and are inrerested in helping out in the PC to review papers, send us an email. LChange'19 resulted in a book on Computational approaches to semantic change, and this year, we are considering a special issue journal for invited workshop papers.\nImportant Dates\n Feb. 28, 2022: Paper submission March 26, 2022: Notification of acceptance April 10, 2022: Camera-ready papers due May 26-28, 2022: Workshop date (days will be decided upon later) \nWorkshop Topics  This workshop explores state-of-the-art computational methodologies, theories and digital text resources on exploring the time-varying nature of human language.\nThe aim of this workshop is three-fold. First, we want to provide pioneering researchers who work on computational methods, evaluation, and large-scale modelling of language change an outlet for disseminating cutting-edge research on topics concerning language change. We want to utilize this proposed workshop as a platform for sharing state-of-the-art research progress in this fundamental domain of natural language research.\nSecond, in doing so we want to bring together domain experts across disciplines. by connecting researchers in historical linguistics with those that develop and test computational methods for detecting semantic change and laws of semantic change; and those that need knowledge (of the occurrence and shape) of language change, for example, in digital humanities and computational social sciences where text mining is applied to diachronic corpora subject to e.g., lexical semantic change.\nThird, the detection and modelling of language change using diachronic text and text mining raise undamental theoretical and methodological challenges for future research. Besides these goals, this workshop will also support discussion on the evaluation of computational methodologies for uncovering language change. SemEval2020 Task1 on unsupervised detection of lexical semantic change attracted three figure submission numbers and a total of 21 submitted system papers. Since then, two more tasks have been completed, and we will organize the shared task on Spanish as a part of this workshop.\nWe invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:\n  Novel methods for detecting diachronic semantic change and lexical replacement  Automatic discovery and quantitative evaluation of laws of language change  Computational theories and generative models of language change  Sense-aware (semantic) change analysis  Diachronic word sense disambiguation  Novel methods for diachronic analysis of low-resource languages  Novel methods for diachronic linguistic data visualization  Novel applications and implications of language change detection  Quantification of sociocultural influences on language change  Cross-linguistic, phylogenetic, and developmental approaches to language change  Novel datasets for cross-linguistic and diachronic analyses of language  Shared Task The task will have two subtasks organized in two phases respectively:   discovery, and  binary change detection (detection of sense gain or loss vs. neither).  Note that discovery introduces additional difficulties for models as compared to the more simple semantic change detection, e.g. because a large number of predictions is required and the target words are not preselected, balanced or cleaned. Yet, discovery is an important task, with applications such as lexicography where dictionary makers aim to cover the full vocabulary of a language.\nThe full task description will be published on CodaLab with a short description on the workshop web page. Task organizers: Frank D. Zamora-Reina, Felipe Bravo-Marquez, Dominik Schlechtweg.\nKeynote Talks To be announced\nAlexander Koplenig (Leibniz-Institute for the German Language in Mannheim) Title of talk: Two challenges we face when analyzing diachronic corpora \nAbstract: In my keynote, I want to discuss two important challenges for the quantitative analysis of diachronic corpora that I believe deserve more attention:   The first challenge is the systematic influence of the sample size when it comes to basically all measures in quantitative linguistics (Baayen 2001). By analysing the lexical dynamics of the German weekly news magazine “Der Spiegel” (consisting of approximately 365,000 articles and 237,000,000 words that were published between 1947 and 2017), I show that this influence makes it difficult to quantify lexical dynamics and language change. I will also demonstrate that standard sampling approaches do not solve this problem. I will suggest an approach that is able to break the sample size dependence but presupposes access to the full text data (Koplenig, Wolfer \u0026 Müller-Spitzer 2019).   The second challenge is of methodological nature and relates to the problem of representativeness of diachronic corpora. Labov (1994) famously stated that \"historical documents survive by chance, not by design, and the selection that is available is the product of an unpredictable series of historical accidents.\" By using both Google Books Ngram data (Michel et al. 2010; Koplenig 2015; Pechenick, Danforth \u0026 Dodds 2015) and publicly available data from the German National Bibliography, I will try to show that the problem is even more fundamental, because there is good reason to believe that composition of the body of published written works (from which a corresponding corpus is supposed to be sampled from) systematically changes as a function of time. This makes it difficult to disentangle actual language change from environmental changes in the textual habitat (Szmrecsanyi 2016).  Haim Dubossarsky (Research Fellow at University of Cambridge) Title of talk: [Semantic change in the time of Machine Learning, doing it right!](/pdf/lchange19/lchange_Dubossarsky.pdf)\n--\n Submissions We accept three types of submissions, long and short papers, following the ACL2022 style, and the ACL submission policy, and shared task papers.\nLong papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references, short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content; final versions will be given one additional page of content so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. Abstracts may consist of up to two (2) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Submissions should be sent in electronic forms, using the Softconf START conference management system. The submission site is now available. -- Details on paper length and submission proceedure will be posted once released by ACL2022.\nThe workshop is planned to last two full days. Submissions are open to all, and are to be submitted anonymously. Workshop papers will be refereed through a double-blind peer review process by at least three reviewers with final acceptance decisions made by the workshop organizers. Shared task participants can choose to submit their papers to the shared task where papers will be reviewed by other task participants, or to the main workshop where they will be reviewed according to the normal workshop proceedure.

Compared to changes in sound and grammar, semantic change is the least understood. Ever since, the study of semantic change has progressed steadily, accumulating a vast store of knowledge for over a century, encompassing many languages and language families. This volume offers a survey of this exciting new direction in the study of semantic change, a discussion of the many remaining challenges that we face in pursuing it, and considerably updated and extended versions of a selection of the contributions to the LChange'19 workshop, addressing both more theoretical problems — e.g., discovery of *laws of semantic change* — and practical applications, such as information retrieval in longitudinal text archives.","tags":[],"title":"Computational approaches to semantic change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nina Tahmasebi","Lars Borin","Adam Jatowt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629583200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629583200,"objectID":"5de2c8c2fd7ac2bb095962e30a16ad93","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/publication/2021-semchange-surveypaper/","publishdate":"2021-08-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-semchange-surveypaper/","section":"publication","summary":"Our languages are in constant flux driven by external factors such as cultural, societal and technological changes, as well as by only partially understood internal motivations.

We first overview approaches aiming to develop systems that support understanding semantic change in an interactive and visual way. It is generally accepted that computational techniques developed for analyzing and uncovering semantic change are beneficial to linguists, historians, sociologists, and practitioners in numerous related fields, especially within the humanities. However, quite a few non-professional users are equally interested in the histories of words. Developing interactive, visual, engaging, and easy-to-understand systems can help them to acquire relevant knowledge. Second, we believe that other fields could benefit from the research outcomes of computational approaches to lexical semantic change. In general, properly representing the meaning of terms used in the past should be important for a range of natural language processing, information retrieval and other tasks that operate on old texts.

Most of the research so far has focused on methods for modelling and detecting semantic change using large diachronic textual data, with the majority of the approaches employing neural embeddings. While methods that offer easy modelling of diachronic text are one of the main reasons for the spiking interest in LSC, neural models leave many aspects of the problem unsolved. The field has several open and complex challenges. In this chapter, we aim to describe the most important of these challenges and outline future directions.","tags":[],"title":"Challenges for computational lexical semantic change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nina Tahmasebi","Adam Jatowt","Yang Xu","Simon Hengchen","Syrielle Montariol","Haim Dubossarsky"],"categories":null,"content":"The workshop builds upon its first iteration in 2019, where we received over 50 submissions and had over 65 attendees. Just like the first one, the second LChange workshop will be co-located with ACL (2021), and, pending on the situation, a hybrid event with possible online participation. We hope to make our second edition another resounding success!\nThe call for papers will be similar to last time: all aspects around computational approaches to historical language change with the focus on digital text corpora. If you have published in the field previously, and are inrerested in helping out in the PC to review papers, send us an email.\nWe will have two keynote talks, and our first confirmed keynote is Alexander Koplenig (Leibniz-Institute for the German Language in Mannheim) with the talk Two challenges we face when analyzing diachronic corpora. \nImportant Dates\n April 26, 2021: Paper submission May 28, 2021: Notification of acceptance June 7, 2021: Camera-ready papers due August 5-6, 2021: Workshop date (day will be decided upon later) \nWorkshop Topics Human language changes over time, driven by the dual needs of adapting to ongoing sociocultural and technological development in the world and facilitating efficient communication. In particular, novel words are coined or borrowed from other languages, while obsolete words slide into obscurity. Similarly, words may acquire novel meanings or lose existing meanings. This workshop explores these phenomena by bringing to bear state-of-the-art computational methodologies, theories and digital text resources on exploring the time-varying nature of human language.\nAlthough there exists rich empirical work on language change from historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and cognitive linguistics, computational approaches to the problem of language change particularly how word forms and meanings evolve have only begun to take shape over the past decade or so, with exemplary work on semantic change and lexical replacement. The motivation has long been related to search, and understanding in diachronic archives. The emergence of long-term and large-scale digital corpora was the prerequisite and has resulted in a slightly different set of problems for this strand of study than have traditionally been studied in historical linguistics. As an example, studies of lexical replacement have largely focused on named entity change (names of e.g., countries and people that change over time) because of the large effect these name changes have for temporal information retrieval.\nThe aim of this workshop is three-fold. First, within a field that has a lot of challenges (Hengchen et al, 2021) we want to provide pioneering researchers who work on computational methods, evaluation, and large-scale modelling of language change an outlet for disseminating cutting-edge research on topics concerning language change. Currently, researchers in this area have published in a wide range of different venues, from computational linguistics, to cognitive science and digital archiving venues (Tahmasebi et al, 2021). Building on its previous edition, we want to utilize this workshop as a platform for sharing state-of-the-art research progress in this fundamental domain of natural language research.\nSecond, in doing so we want to bring together domain experts across disciplines. We want to connect those that have long worked on language change within historical linguistics and bring with them a large understanding for general linguistic theories of language change; those that have studied change across languages and language families; those that develop and test computational methods for detecting semantic change and laws of semantic change; and those that need knowledge (of the occurrence and shape) of language change, for example, in digital humanities and computational social sciences where text mining is applied to diachronic corpora subject to lexical semantic change.\nThird, the detection and modelling of language change using diachronic text and text mining raise fundamental theoretical and methodological challenges for future research in this area. The representativeness of text is a first critical issue; works using large diachronic corpora and computational methods for detecting change often claim to find changes that are universally true for a language as a whole. But the jury is out on how results derived from digital literature or newspapers accurately represent changes in language as a whole. We hope to engage corpus linguists, big-data scientists, and computational linguists to address these open issues. Besides these goals, this workshop will also support discussion on the evaluation of computational methodologies for uncovering language change. Verifying change only using positive examples of change often confirms a corpus bias rather than reflecting genuine language change. Larger quantities and higher qualities of text over time result in the detection of more semantic change. In fact, multiple semantic laws have been proposed lately where later other authors have shown that the detected effects are linked to frequency rather than underlying semantic change . The methodological issue of evaluation, together with good evaluation testsets and standards are of high importance to the research community. We aim to shed some light on these issues and encourage the community to collaborate to find solutions.\nThe work in semantic change detection [1] has, to a large extent, moved to (neural) embedding techniques in recent years . These methods have several drawbacks: the need for very large datasets to produce stable embeddings, and the fact that all semantic information of a word is encoded in a single vector thus limiting the possibility to study word senses separately. A move towards multi-sense embeddings will most likely require even more texts per time unit, which will limit the applicability of these methods to other languages than English and a few others. We want to bring about a discussion on the need for methods that can discriminate and disambiguate among a word's senses (meanings) and that can be used for resource-poor languages with little hope of acquiring the order of magnitude of words needed for creating stable embeddings, possibly using dynamic embeddings that seem to require less text. Finally, knowledge of language change is useful not only on its own, but as a basis for other diachronic textual investigations and in search. A digital humanities investigation into the living conditions of young women through history cannot rely on the word girl in English, as in the past the reference of girl also included young men. Automatic detecting of language change is useful for many researchers outside of the communities that study the changes themselves and develop methods for their detection. By reaching out to these other communities, we can better understand how to utilize the results for further research and for presenting them to the interested public. In addition, we need good user interfaces and systems for exploring language changes in corpora, for example, to allow for serendipitous discovery of interesting phenomena . In addition to facilitate research on texts, information about language changes is used for measuring document across-time similarity, information retrieval from long-term document archives, the design of OCR algorithms and so on.\nWe invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:\n  Novel methods for detecting diachronic semantic change and lexical replacement  Automatic discovery and quantitative evaluation of laws of language change  Computational theories and generative models of language change  Sense-aware (semantic) change analysis  Diachronic word sense disambiguation  Novel methods for diachronic analysis of low-resource languages  Novel methods for diachronic linguistic data visualization  Novel applications and implications of language change detection  Quantification of sociocultural influences on language change  Cross-linguistic, phylogenetic, and developmental approaches to language change  Novel datasets for cross-linguistic and diachronic analyses of language \nKeynote Talks Confirmed Speaker:\nAlexander Koplenig (Leibniz-Institute for the German Language in Mannheim) Title of talk: Two challenges we face when analyzing diachronic corpora \nAbstract: In my keynote, I want to discuss two important challenges for the quantitative analysis of diachronic corpora that I believe deserve more attention:   The first challenge is the systematic influence of the sample size when it comes to basically all measures in quantitative linguistics (Baayen 2001). By analysing the lexical dynamics of the German weekly news magazine “Der Spiegel” (consisting of approximately 365,000 articles and 237,000,000 words that were published between 1947 and 2017), I show that this influence makes it difficult to quantify lexical dynamics and language change. I will also demonstrate that standard sampling approaches do not solve this problem. I will suggest an approach that is able to break the sample size dependence but presupposes access to the full text data (Koplenig, Wolfer \u0026amp; Müller-Spitzer 2019).   The second challenge is of methodological nature and relates to the problem of representativeness of diachronic corpora. Labov (1994) famously stated that \u0026ldquo;historical documents survive by chance, not by design, and the selection that is available is the product of an unpredictable series of historical accidents.\u0026rdquo; By using both Google Books Ngram data (Michel et al. 2010; Koplenig 2015; Pechenick, Danforth \u0026amp; Dodds 2015) and publicly available data from the German National Bibliography, I will try to show that the problem is even more fundamental, because there is good reason to believe that composition of the body of published written works (from which a corresponding corpus is supposed to be sampled from) systematically changes as a function of time. This makes it difficult to disentangle actual language change from environmental changes in the textual habitat (Szmrecsanyi 2016). \nHaim Dubossarsky (Research Fellow at University of Cambridge) Title of talk: [Semantic change in the time of Machine Learning, doing it right!](/pdf/lchange19/lchange_Dubossarsky.pdf)\n--  Submissions We accept three types of submissions, long papers, short papers and abstracts, following the ACL2021 style, and the ACL submission policy.\nLong papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references, short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content; final versions will be given one additional page of content so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.

We learn new words, add new meanings to existing words and change meanings to better describe our time and culture. We forget fast and when looking back, for example in old newspaper material, these lexical and semantic changes make it difficult to understand what has been said. In addition, they hinder us when we want to apply text mining on historical corpora, for example, to track sentiments over time.  Automatic detection of language change is a field that has gotten increasing attention over the past decade. Due to digital corpora containing more data and spanning over more time, combined with new and powerful embedding technologies, methods for e.g., word sense change have become very popular.  Despite these initial efforts, we lack computational tools for studying lexical and semantic changes at a large scale. Current methods are limited in what they can find and methods for creating (neural) word embeddings that are the state-of-the-art in e.g., sense change detection require sufficiently large datasets. For (historical) Swedish and most other languages, the situation is different with fairly small-sized data with a high error rate.  This workshop aims to bring together a community of researchers in Sweden that focus on different aspects of language change detection, both from a qualitative and manual as well as a quantitative, automatic detection perspective. We believe that such a workshop is needed for Sweden to be in the forefront of this research, in particular since few others will aim to find solutions particular to Swedish.  We invite presentations but no full papers, to encourage participants from a wide range of fields. We intend a low-key workshop that will start with a keynote and continue with each participant getting a chance to present themselves and their work, to find possible collaborations (preferably across topics and fields) and better utilize existing efforts and datasets. We hope to bring together technology providers, data providers, and users such as researchers with interest in historical texts but with expertise outside of language technology (like digital humanities, historical linguistics, history of ideas, sociology, history etc.). After a coffee break and the presentations, we will have one more keynote and continue with some discussions and a planning session for collaboration and a further workshop.  There will be no published proceedings and the workshop is planned for around half a day. Please contact nina . tahmasebi at gu . se or simon . hengchen at gu . se to propose presentations, with a preliminary title, a short description (maximum of 1 written page), and whether you would prefer a long or a short presentation. We are planning for presentations of 15-20 minutes for finished work and 5-10 minutes for ongoing work, but this can change depending on the number of presentations. Examples of welcomed talks include:  You are a linguist, anthropologist, historian etc. who is interested in how a certain word or a certain concept developed and changed in Swedish language or culture over time. You have done corpus studies, but mainly manual, and wish to explore if there are computational methods or collaborations that could add more value to your research. You are a quantitative researcher with an interesting method that finds patterns in e.g. time series data, and wonder if there are good data sets and research questions to use this on. You are a linguist with a theory about how semantic change proceeds or how new words are added to a language, looking for new methods to falsify your hypotheses.   Confirmed Speakers: Dominik Schlechtweg, IMS Stuttgart.  Title and abstract: Sparse Usage Graphs as Model for Word Meaning in Context Usage Graphs represent the uses of a word as nodes in a graph. Edge weights represent semantic proximity between uses, according to which they can be grouped into use clusters representing the same sense. This gives access to the number of senses a word expresses at any point of time (polysemy) and to changes in these senses over time (lexical semantic change). While reliable usage graphs can be obtained from human semantic proximity judgments, this puts strong constraints on the number of edges that can be annotated. Hence, we need sampling techniques presenting a limited number of edges to annotators, while guaranteeing that the correct clustering can be obtained from the resulting sparse graphs. I will present several recent studies on usage graphs and how they can be obtained reliably and efficiently. I will show that they are a useful, simple and well-defined model for word meaning in context, opening up a completely new set of problems in lexical semantics.  Confirmed Speakers: Stellan Petersson \u0026 Emma Sköldberg, University of Gothenburg  Title and abstract: Lexical Semantics and Semantic Change – a Report from the Lexicographer’s Shop Floor The results from computational studies are relevant to practical dictionary editing. In the ongoing work on the second edition of the dictionary Svensk ordbok utgiven av Svenska Akademien (“The Contemporary Dictionary of the Swedish Academy”), semantic changes on the lexical level are important. But the editorial group, of which we are members, currently lack formal methods for discovering them. The purpose of this talk is to share some of the research questions and problems dealtwithin everyday, hands-on lexicographic work, in order to initiate a dialogue between lexicography and language technology. A first question is: what is lexical semantic change? A second question: are modifications in emotive meaning semantic changes? Third: context dependence of meaning is expected from a synchronic perspective. Finally: if a change is noticed, what kind is it? These issues will be discussed in the talk.  The workshop is organized by Språkbanken.

Often, the motivations for studying lexical semantic change differ between data science or NLP, and traditional studies in e.g., historical linguistics. This has implications on methods, data, and evaluation techniques. Because of the focus on historical English with its relatively high quality and large volumes of available digital text, the field tends to focus on solutions that are not always suitable for other languages. In addition, the complexity of the problem, and its evaluation over long time spans, has led to ad hoc and non-comparable evaluation. I will discuss our current efforts (and huge challenges) on creating a large annotated test set for SemEval2020. Through the creation of ground-truth for German, Swedish, and Latin in addition to English, we aim to bring the community closer to standardized, comparable testing of methods across languages with different features and digital text quality. In its short history as a sub-field in NLP, lexical semantic change has seen detection methods that have ranged from count-based vectors, cluster-based and topic model-based methods, to predictive vectors created from neural embedding spaces, and now the latest contextualized vectors. I will present the great advances made so far and discuss current and future challenges.","tags":["Language Change Detection","Evaluation"],"title":"Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection – Past, Present \u0026 Future","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nina Tahmasebi","Simon Hengchen","Dominik Schlechtweg","Barbara McGillivray","Haim Dubossarsky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582066800,"objectID":"6cf0f295dd1d43de709985babb8f5fc0","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/publication/2020-semeval2020-swedishdata/","publishdate":"2020-02-19T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-semeval2020-swedishdata/","section":"publication","summary":"This data collection contains the Swedish test data for SemEval 2020 Task 1: Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection.

Whenever we have a chance to meet, we realize how much we all have to gain by intertwining our perspectives and knowledge. This time, Nina and Susanne got together in Gothenburg for two days, and Richard joined our first day. We talked about many things - for example:\n What is meaning? At the moment, word vectors treat meaning as (extant in the corpora) use. Is there meaning to a word apart from its use? And while current methods are limited by the available data, future methods will be able to utilize mulit-modal information, text is extended with tone, facial expressions, images, sound, smell and so on. With such data, we might be able to tease apart denotation from connotation, and determine that while the core meaning of horse has stayed stable (a horse is an animal with four legs, etc, and most of us would be able to pick a horse from a range of other animals), the use of the horse as a means of transportation and its central use in agriculture has radically changed. So, can we say that the horse is stable or changing in meaning? Today, meaning can almost only be modeled as usage, but the future has much more in store for us!\n Inspired by the PhD thesis of G Rundblad (1997) on watercourse nouns in English, we started thinking about what happens to words when an entire lexical field collapses - words disappear, previous detailed small differences in meaning are no longer important. This is lexical semantic change when we see change in both meaning and reference. More on this will come!\n We also met up with lexicographers to discuss where to find digitally available data on when Swedish words and senses first appeared. The lexicas on https://svenska.se/ are a good starting point. SAOB is a great lexicon on word meanings, but for a simple list of words and their earliest attestation, SAOB is too complex. SO (Svensk Ordbok) which tries to cover the middle ground between SAOB and the word list SAOL is a good alternative. We can also recommend, as long as it is available, a \u0026ldquo;backdoor\u0026rdquo; into the old user interface to SAOB, where much more detailed searches are possible: the now deprecated OSA interface http://www2.saob.se/osa/index.phtml .\n One of our major concerns is validation - we need high quality studies on lexical change that the word vector approach is validated on. To that end, we came up with five different student projects for Stockholm University\u0026rsquo;s autumn course in Linguistics Project Work, all about language change.\n  All in all we had a very inspiring meeting, and are looking forward to the ACL workshop!

In particular, novel words are coined or borrowed from other languages, while obsolete words slide into obscurity. Similarly, words may acquire novel meanings or lose existing meanings. This workshop explores these phenomena by bringing to bear state-of-the-art computational methodologies, theories and digital text resources on exploring the time-varying nature of human language.\nAlthough there exists rich empirical work on language change from historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and cognitive linguistics, computational approaches to the problem of language change particularly how word forms and meanings evolve have only begun to take shape over the past decade or so, with exemplary work on semantic change and lexical replacement . The motivation has long been related to search, and understanding in diachronic archives . The emergence of long-term and large-scale digital corpora was the prerequisite and has resulted in a slightly different set of problems for this strand of study than have traditionally been studied in historical linguistics. As an example, studies of lexical replacement have largely focused on named entity change (names of e.g., countries and people that change over time) because of the large effect these name changes have for temporal information retrieval.\nThe aim of this workshop is three-fold. First, we want to provide pioneering researchers who work on computational methods, evaluation, and large-scale modelling of language change an outlet for disseminating cutting-edge research on topics concerning language change. Currently, researchers in this area have published in a wide range of different venues, from computational linguistics, to cognitive science and digital archiving venues. We want to utilize this proposed workshop as a platform for sharing state-of-the-art research progress in this fundamental domain of natural language research.\nSecond, in doing so we want to bring together domain experts across disciplines. We want to connect those that have long worked on language change within historical linguistics and bring with them a large understanding for general linguistic theories of language change; those that have studied change across languages and language families; those that develop and test computational methods for detecting semantic change and laws of semantic change; and those that need knowledge (of the occurrence and shape) of language change, for example, in digital humanities and computational social sciences where text mining is applied to diachronic corpora subject to lexical semantic change.\nThird, the detection and modelling of language change using diachronic text and text mining raise fundamental theoretical and methodological challenges for future research in this area. The representativeness of text is a first critical issue; works using large diachronic corpora and computational methods for detecting change often claim to find changes that are universally true for a language as a whole. But the jury is out on how results derived from digital literature or newspapers accurately represent changes in language as a whole. We hope to engage corpus linguists, big-data scientists, and computational linguists to address these open issues. Besides these goals, this workshop will also support discussion on the evaluation of computational methodologies for uncovering language change. Verifying change only using positive examples of change often confirms a corpus bias rather than reflecting genuine language change. Larger quantities and higher qualities of text over time result in the detection of more semantic change. In fact, multiple semantic laws have been proposed lately where later other authors have shown that the detected effects are linked to frequency rather than underlying semantic change . The methodological issue of evaluation, together with good evaluation testsets and standards are of high importance to the research community. We aim to shed some light on these issues and encourage the community to collaborate to find solutions.\nThe work in semantic change detection1 has, to a large extent, moved to (neural) embedding techniques in recent years . These methods have several drawbacks: the need for very large datasets to produce stable embeddings, and the fact that all semantic information of a word is encoded in a single vector thus limiting the possibility to study word senses separately. A move towards multi-sense embeddings will most likely require even more texts per time unit, which will limit the applicability of these methods to other languages than English and a few others. We want to bring about a discussion on the need for methods that can discriminate and disambiguate among a word's senses (meanings) and that can be used for resource-poor languages with little hope of acquiring the order of magnitude of words needed for creating stable embeddings, possibly using dynamic embeddings that seem to require less text . Finally, knowledge of language change is useful not only on its own, but as a basis for other diachronic textual investigations and in search. A digital humanities investigation into the living conditions of young women through history cannot rely on the word girl in English, as in the past the reference of girl also included young men. Automatic detecting of language change is useful for many researchers outside of the communities that study the changes themselves and develop methods for their detection. By reaching out to these other communities, we can better understand how to utilize the results for further research and for presenting them to the interested public. In addition, we need good user interfaces and systems for exploring language changes in corpora, for example, to allow for serendipitous discovery of interesting phenomena . In addition to facilitate research on texts, information about language changes is used for measuring document across-time similarity, information retrieval from long-term document archives, the design of OCR algorithms and so on.\nWe invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:\n Automatic detection of semantic change and diachronic lexical replacement Fundamental laws of language change Computational theories and generative models of language change Sense-aware (semantic) change analysis Methodologies for resource-poor languages Diachronic linguistic data visualization and online systems Applications and implications of language change detection Sociocultural influences on language change Cross-linguistic and phylogenetic approaches to language change Methodological aspects of, as well as datasets for, evaluation  Submissions We accept three types of submissions, long papers, short papers and abstracts, following the ACL2019 style, and the ACL submission policy.\nLong papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references, short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content; final versions will be given one additional page of content so that reviewers\u0026rsquo; comments can be taken into account. Abstracts may consist of up to two (2) pages of content, plus unlimited references. Submissions should be sent in electronic forms, using the Softconf START conference management system.

The fact that these methods discover meaning representations automatically makes them attractive as a research tool in investigations where our goal is to discover semantic shifts in diachronic corpora. However, most previous applications of word embeddings in investigations of semantic change have been limited because the common types of word embeddings do not distinguish between different senses of words, which makes the results harder to interpret. In this talk, we describe a number of extensions of diachronic word embedding models that allow them to express sense distinctions, and describe some preliminary experiments where we apply these models in diachronic English corpora.","tags":["Language Change Detection","Evaluation"],"title":"Discovering Semantic Shifts Using Diachronic Word Sense Embeddings","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nina Tahmasebi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550491200,"objectID":"30c76ead67fb1ddd32e8060b35c3fec5","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/talk/2019-stuttgart/","publishdate":"2019-02-18T13:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-stuttgart/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk I will give an overview of the work done in computational detection of semantic change over the past decade.

While the study of meaning is not a new thing, the past few years have seen a lot of attention given to the computational tackling of particular tasks within (historical) semantics. Advances in NLP and the availability of massive textual corpora have made possible new research methods focused on lexical semantic change, using a range of approaches varying from topic models to neural word embeddings. Knowing what a word means at a particular moment of time is crucial for text-based research in the humanities. While current computational methods present solutions for some contexts (typically recent English, with clean data), this growing community lacks an extensive overview of existing work on the one hand, and an interdisciplinary discussion between major parties and fields interested in the topic on the other. In all works, the evaluation of results and the comparison between approaches is close to impossible: the lack of a standardised definition of what lexical semantic change is both in general terms and with regard to different corpora and time spans, as well as the inadequacy (or absence) of current evaluation frameworks, makes reproducing methods in other contexts very difficult.\nMore information More information on the workshop, locations and dates can be found here.\n","date":1548318600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548318600,"objectID":"f3a4cd8c9d15061f2adfb71b042c3773","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/events/2019-acl-lcworkshop---copy/","publishdate":"2019-01-24T09:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/events/2019-acl-lcworkshop---copy/","section":"events","summary":"In this workshop, which takes place in the context of the DH research seminar series at the University of Helsinki, we wish to foster discussions on lexical semantic change, between NLP researchers, (digital) historians, and historical linguists.

For English, evaluated methods (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Brody and Lapata, 2009; Lau et al., 2012) exist and new methods are developed, the latest is the utilization of word embeddings (Nieto Piña and Johansson, 2015; Trask et al., 2015; Pelevina et al., 2016; Li and Jurafsky, 2015). For Swedish, these methods have not been tested at large scale and might perform less well due to smaller amounts of available text.\nIn our previous work, we performed small-scale evaluation of embedding-based methods and the curvature clustering method (Dorow et al., 2005) on our historical newspaper corpus Kubhist. Neither of these have proven very effective and it remains to investigate the reasons, e.g., corpora size, level of noise or differences in morphology and syntax.\nThe plan We will adapt, develop and evaluate methods that are tailored to Swedish; and keep links to original contexts, hence providing evidence of each sense.

For example, synchronically: there are cognitively different kinds of temperature sensations, which form overt or covert sub-senses (Koptjevskaja-Tamm, 2015), that may be handled by different grammatical constructions (Pustet, 2015). Diachronically: word senses often go from describing external reality to internal perception (Traugott and Dasher, 2002); change often proceeds from a higher sensory modality to a lower (Viberg, 1980); perception verbs develop into cognitive verbs (Sweetser, 1991); or the exact hues denoted by Swedish color terms may change in a predictable fashion over time (Vejdemo, 2017).\nThe first methods for automatic detection of word sense change were based on context vectors; they investigated semantic density (Sagi et al., 2009) and utilized mutual information (Gulordava and Baroni, 2011) to identify semantic change over time; both methods detect signals of change but neither aligns senses over time or determines what changed.\nTopic-based models (where topics are interpreted as senses) were used to detect novel senses by identifying new topics in a later corpus compared to an earlier one (Lau et al. (2012); Cook et al. (2014)), or by clustering topics over time (Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011). A dynamic topic model where topics for time t are learned with respect to topics from time $t-1$ is proposed by Frermann and Lapata (2016). With one exception, no alignment is made between topics to allow following the diachronic progression of a sense.\nGraph-based models are utilized by Mitra et al. (2015, 2014) and Tahmasebi and Risse (2017) and aim to revealing complex relations between a word’s senses by (a) modeling senses per se using WSI; and (b) aligning senses over time. The models allow differentiation of individual senses at different periods in time and the latter also group senses into linguistically related concepts (Cooper, 2005).\nThe largest body of work is done using word embeddings of different kinds in the last years (Basile et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Embeddings are trained on different time-sliced corpora and compared over time. Kulkarni et al. (2015) project words onto their frequency, POS and semantic vectors and propose a model for detecting statistically significant changes between time periods. Hamilton et al. (2016) view both similarity between a priori known pairs of words, and between a word’s vectors over time to detect change and have released HistWords, a set of pre-trained historical word embeddings. Basile et al. (2016); Hamilton et al. (2016); Kulkarni et al. (2015) all propose different methods for projecting vectors from different time periods onto the same space to allow comparison. Bamler and Mandt (2017), Yao et al. (2018) and Rudolph and Blei (2018) propose using dynamic embeddings to completely avoid projection, which results in smoother diachronic embeddings.\nExisting methods for detecting change based on word embeddings do not allow us to recover individual senses; they model words with one vector per time unit and detect meaning change as change in the direction of those vectors. Once a change point is found, the most similar words around that time are used to illustrate the change. However, the most similar terms will only represent the dominant sense; they will not reflect the other senses or capture stable parts of a word. If multisense embeddings are used, to allow senses to be modeled individually, we again face multiple vectors for each time point, over hundreds of years, leading to an overwhelming result space. Solving this reduction and investigating the tradeoff between a large results space and information loss during reduction, is at the core of this field and largely ignored in previous work.\nFor a larger survey over the field, please see a draft of our survey paper.\nThe plan Existing approaches to change detection derive sense representations first and compare these over time. The most recent approaches make use of vector representations, providing a methodology thatcan answer when something has changed, but not how. In addition, vector representations have the target word as one unit without differentiating between a word’s senses and work poorly on smaller corpora (which our historical corpora are, but also our modern corpora might be if we split them up in e.g. yearly subsets). Therefore, we need to go beyond vector representations in the following ways, (i) model word senses separately e.g. using multi-sense embeddings; (ii) allow all senses to change individually; (iii) differentiate change types (novel /outdated senses, broadening/narrowing, related/un-related senses as well as stable senses); (iv) model the relation between the senses; and (v) handle smaller amounts of (noisy) text.\nOur experiments, e.g., Tahmasebi et al (2017), show that a word like the telephone have senses in actual usage indicating that the word goes from being a property of a building to the belonging to each household to being a tool for communication much like a radio, television or a newspaper. The word travel has always had the moving from point A to point B sense but was mostly used for describing literature; people read about traveling. First in the early 20th century, the word usage added the sense of actual travel by means of train, boat and eventually airplane, the literature sense still being valid but less frequent. This usage change is extremely interesting, reflects cultural change rather than explicit sense change, and is found only if we differentiate and align a word’s senses over time.\nWe will investigate count-based methods like SVDppmi (Hamilton et al., 2016) that do not suffer from randomness, and the dynamic embeddings, which increase robustness by automatically aligning embeddings at different time points, will be extended to account for multiple word senses. In addition, we will go beyond analyzing individual words to capture changes in semantic fields.\nUsing sense-differentiated embeddings targeted for small amounts of data, and our reduction techniques, we will answer what happens to all senses of a word over time, allowing senses to change individually while others stay stable for the same word. We will focus on precision, which is particularly important for uptake, i.e., presenting good quality results without too much noise. We will find (and rank) good text passages that exemplify each meaning and change.\nAs proof of concept, we will revisit and enlarge several previous manually executed case studies on synchronic word sense variation and diachronic word sense change in Swedish, and look deeper into active lexical semantics research fields such as temperature, color, and smell. We will approach the under-investigated topic of how word senses change with different speed and processes in different linguistic sources (the inertia of change differs in e.g. fiction and newspapers) and different time periods (some, but not all, published work have noted an increased level of semantic change after the world wars, see e.g. Juola (2003) )\nReferences R.

Some proposed general hypotheses are that nouns are replaced more readily than verbs, that more frequent words are insulated from replacement (Pagel et al., 2007) and that rich synonym networks speed up replacement (Vejdemo and Hörberg, 2016), hypotheses that we can investigate using quantitative approaches on large scale, diachronic text upon completion of this project.\nPrevious work on automatic detection of lexical replacement has been very limited and mainly focused on named entity changes. The interest has mostly been from an information retrieval (IR) perspective (Anand et al. (2012); Berberich et al. (2007, 2009); Morsy and Karypis (2016)). Kanhabua and Nørvåg (2010) find semantically related named entities using Wikipedia links, limiting the method to modern, common domain entities and evaluate indirectly in an IR setting. Kaluarachchi et al. (2010) propose to find named entities via linked verbs that relate over time, referring the problem to diachronic linking of verbs. These attempts are computationally expensive, as they require recurrent computations because the target time is unknown beforehand.\nIn our previous work, Tahmasebi et al. (2012), we rely on bursts in frequency to detect time periods in which we search for name change thus eliminating recurrent computation. In all work, changes are only found pairwise, senses are not differentiated and there is no validity period associated with each name. By finding word replacements after having found word sense changes, we can generalize beyond names and overcome many of these obstacles.\nThe plan Automatic detection of lexical replacements over time has only previously targeted named entities. Previous work like Zhang et al. (2016) and Berberich et al. (2009) have used word context rather than sense information, which is suitable for (unambiguous) named entities but not for words in general. Contrary to word sense change, we are targeting senses that are stable over time, so we require the induced senses to exhibit only minor variation to represent the same underlying sense. The problem requires (i) deriving word senses; (ii) tracking word senses over time; and (iii) linking words to word senses to find a word that has been used to replace another for a given sense (not necessarily for all senses of a word).\nWe will investigate multi-sense embeddings for labeling, extend current word pairs to create chains of change, e.g. ipod $ \\xleftarrow[2012-2001]{}$ mp3 player $ \\xleftarrow[2001-1996]{} $ minidisc $\\xleftarrow[1996-1992]{}$ discman $\\xleftarrow[1984-1979]{}$ walkman for the word sense of mobile music player; and assign validity periods for follow up applications (e.g., Information retrieval) and understanding. We will analyze systematic errors to automatically reduce false positives, e.g., ear phones, tape, disc, Sony, Apple for the above, thus rendering the results useless.\nNon-automatic research is producing interesting hypotheses on word replacement, identifying replacement affecting factors such as frequency (Pagel et al., 2007) and synonym network density (Vejdemo and Hörberg, 2016) but much of this is based on small over-used databases of core vocabulary. We will address these hypotheses with large, diachronic datasets.\nFor research on language change in general, we will investigate methods to link semantic change and lexical replacement changes (as well as spelling variations) to present all changes to a word and other words in its semantic field, in a scrollable and clickable map with links to relevant text passages, with the aim that it should be understandable and searchable.\nReferences A.

These tools give us a chance to study language changes in their own right but also overcome hurdles with research on historical text. We will bring together historical linguistics with NLP and data science, a unique collaboration needed to study semantic change and lexical replacements in full.\nWe believe the results of the project will advance the field in several research areas, offer benefits for researchers in the DHSS and lower the threshold for the public to make use of our textual resources.\nThe plan The application areas aim to highlight all kinds of change and apply to researchers as well as the public.\nClose reading (Simplify research) In this use case, we will help users (researchers and laymen) to firstly find, and secondly understand content in digital archives by (1) implementing features that suggest extension to search queries with relevant word replacements and their validity periods, and (2) in a text, highlight words that have changed their meaning. Changes will be accompanied with the original passages of text such that users can verify the results, or get new entry points into the corpus.\nDistant reading (Quantify Research hypothesis) Many researchers are moving into DHSS (as seen by the increasing number of centers for Digital Humanities across Swedish universities), drawn in by the promise of large amounts of data and automatic methods for analyzing them. In this use case, we will collaborate with three research groups to help quantify their hypotheses.\n Firstly, we will collaborate with social scientists on analyzing differences in meaning for concepts in politics (e.g. democracy, freedom, immigration) for different political parties, this relates primarily to word sense induction on 20th century Swedish political party programs and election manifestos.\nSecondly, we will collaborate with a group of concept historians to investigate the rate and spread of abstraction of the market, that goes from a concrete time and place to an abstract concept, like job or stock markets. We will study the interplay of these concept and investigate when the market becomes an agent that affects people rather than the other way around. Once the first abstract market has been established as a concept, does the process move faster and faster with new abstract markets and can we quantify this rate?\nThirdly, we will work with historical linguists to show that scientific texts in the 18th century attributed human-like features to animals and plants, see e.g., Linné and Bjerkander. By applying semantic change detection to the Royal Science Academy texts, as well as to texts from other contemporary genres, we can help quantify the hypothesis, and find spread and change rate. This collaboration will take place after the digitization of the relevant texts, pending a funding application. References L. Borin, M. Forsberg, and J. Roxendal.

Words acquire new meanings and lose old senses, new words are coined or borrowed from other languages and obsolete words slide into obscurity. Understanding the characteristics of shifts in the meaning and in the use of words is useful for those who work with the content of historical texts, the interested general public, but also in and of itself. The findings from automatic lexical semantic change detection, and the models of diachronic conceptual change are currently being incorporated in approaches for measuring document across-time similarity, information retrieval from long-term document archives, the design of OCR algorithms, and so on. In recent years we have seen a surge in interest in the academic community in computational methods and tools supporting inquiry into diachronic conceptual change and lexical replacement.

We learn new words, add new meanings to existing words and change meanings to better describe our time and culture. We forget fast and when looking back, for example in old newspaper material, these lexical and semantic changes make it difficult to understand what has been said. In addition, they hinder us when we want to apply text mining on historical corpora, for example, to track sentiments over time.  Automatic detection of language change is a field that has gotten increasing attention over the past decade. Due to digital corpora containing more data and spanning over more time, combined with new and powerful embedding technologies, methods for e.g., word sense change have become very popular.  Despite these initial efforts, we lack computational tools for studying lexical and semantic changes at a large scale. Current methods are limited in what they can find and methods for creating (neural) word embeddings that are the state-of-the-art in e.g., sense change detection require sufficiently large datasets. For (historical) Swedish and most other languages, the situation is different with fairly small-sized data with a high error rate.  This workshop aims to bring together a community of researchers in Sweden that focus on different aspects of language change detection, both from a qualitative and manual as well as a quantitative, automatic detection perspective. We believe that such a workshop is needed for Sweden to be in the forefront of this research, in particular since few others will aim to find solutions particular to Swedish. The workshop will include a poster session on general tools for language technology by SweClarin.  We invite presentations but no papers in this first round, to encourage participants from a wide range of fields. We intend a low-key workshop that will start with a keynote and continue with each participant getting a chance to present themselves and their work, to find possible collaborations (preferably across topics and fields) and better utilize existing efforts and datasets. We hope to bring together technology providers, data providers, and users such as researchers with interest in historical texts but with expertise outside of language technology (like digital humanities, historical linguistics, history of ideas, sociology, history etc.). After a coffee break and the presentations, we will have one more keynote and continue with some discussions and a planning session for collaboration and a further workshop.  There will be no published proceedings and the workshop is planned for half a day. Please contact nina . tahmasebi at gu . se or yvonne . adesam at gu . se to propose presentations, with a preliminary title and a short description (maximum of 1 written page). We are planning for presentations of 15-20 minutes for finished work and 5-10 minutes for ongoing work. Examples of welcomed talks include:  You are a linguist, anthropologist, historian etc. who is interested in how a certain word or a certain concept developed and changed in Swedish language or culture over time. You have done corpus studies, but mainly manual, and wish to explore if there are computational methods or collaborations that could add more value to your research. You are a quantitative researcher with an interesting method that finds patterns in e.g. time series data, and wonder if there are good data sets and research questions to use this on. You are a linguist with a theory about how semantic change proceeds or how new words are added to a language, looking for new methods to falsify your hypotheses.   Confirmed Speakers: Susanne Vejdemo, Nina Tahmasebi, Lena Rogström  The workshop will be held in Aula Magna at Stockholm University’s Frescati campus. The room in Aula Magna is called Bergsmannen, but there will be signs showing you to the way inside the building.

Most current methods rely on new, powerful embedding technologies, but do not differentiate between different senses of a word, which is needed in many applications in the digital humanities. Of course, this radically reduces the complexity, but often fails to answer questions like: what changed and how, and when did the change occur? In this talk, I will present methods for automatically detecting sense change from large amounts of diachronic data. I will focus on a study on a Historical Swedish Newspaper Corpus, the Kubhist dataset with digitized Swedish newspapers from 1749-1925. I will present our work with detecting and correcting OCR errors, normalizing spelling variations, and creating representations for individual words using a popular neural embedding method, namely Word2Vec. Methods for creating (neural) word embeddings are the state-of-the-art in sense change detection, and many other areas of study, and mainly studied on English corpora where the size of the datasets are sufficiently large. I will discuss the limitations of such methods for this particular context; fairly small-sized data with a high error rate as is common in a historical context for most languages. In addition, I will discuss the particularities of text mining methods for digital humanities and what is needed to bridge the gap between computer science and the digital humanities.","tags":["Digital humanities","Data science","Language Change Detection"],"title":"Estonian Digital Humanities Conference 2018","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Haim Dubossarsky","Simon Hengchen","Nina Tahmasebi","Dominik Schlechtweg"],"categories":null,"content":"This is the story of how four people who did not know each other well, met and spent two weeks working, analyzing and discussing, and ended up with an accepted ACL paper out of the almost 3000 submitted papers.\nIt all started with Simon Hengchen and the ComHis group at the University of Helsinki, that invited the three of us (Haim Dubossarsky, Dominik Schlechtweg and me) to Helsinki for a research stay. We got funding for the trip (thank you University of Helsinki!) and decided on a week in February 2019. Haim wanted us to be bold and have a theoretical chance of submitting to ACL. We started the week on February 18th with a workshop, where we presented our work, all related to lexical semantic change, detection and evaluation.\nNext we sat down in a room and started discussing. After quite some discussions, we agreed on a task and got to work. We worked on temporal referencing of the corpus and the algorithms, the shuffling and control settings as well as building the synthetic corpus, and on the sampling, evaluation, and drafting experiments. And some of us were also in charge of the (liquid) entertainment.\n\r The week went fast and was an amazing experience, we discussed, in pairs or as a group and solved problems as we went along. We agreed on experimental setup, and after lunch and some more hours writing on Friday, we all went back home and spend a weekend at home. After that, an intensive week started, we were seeing results and started analyzing. It felt like we lived a week in front of our computers, Skyping as we went along.\nWhile we had set up the Overleaf project for our paper already during our week in Helsinki, we really started to work on the paper during the last day of February and the first day of March, with the paper deadline being March 4th. The paper had less than 4 pages on March 1st, and on late night March 4th, we were reading the paper from beginning to end for the first time, and discussing changes and consolidating writing styles. We randomly assigned the order of the authors using screen sharing on Simon’s laptop, and gave Haim quite some hardship for having drawn the longest straw.\nThe second to last day, we had some problems with our results, they were showing the exact opposite of what we were expecting and had seen in a previous version. But a late night and a few calls clarified the mistake and we were able to see more convincing results, supporting our initial hypothesis.\nToday, as the acceptance notification came, I am still amazed that we were able to produce a paper (submitted with four minutes to spare) that was lucid enough to get good reviews. Or that we could go from an idea, via implementation and experiments to written results in two weeks. It goes to show what can be done when you get to sit in a room with such smart people and just work. So far, this has been the single most exciting research activity that I have ever participated in. Thank you Simon, Dominik and Haim!\nPs. The four of us, together with Barbara McGillivray, are organizing a SemEval challenge on lexical semantic change detection for English, German, Swedish and Latin.\n","date":1526248800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526248800,"objectID":"496dabec21215bf71ec3a1a8b5cb03f0","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/post/the-two-week-paper/","publishdate":"2018-05-14T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/the-two-week-paper/","section":"post","summary":"Or, the story of how we wrote the Time-Out paper","tags":["Semantic Change"],"title":"The two week-long paper","type":"post"},{"authors":["Nina Tahmasebi","Thomas Risse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504303200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504303200,"objectID":"2c71b717a4089bc1698aa24994bc19ef","permalink":"https://languagechange.org/publication/2017-ranlp-1/","publishdate":"2017-09-02T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-ranlp-1/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a method for detecting word sense changes by utilizing automatically induced word senses.
