      <title>3rd International Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change 2022 (LChange&#39;22)</title>

      <description>The workshop builds upon its first iteration in 2019, and the second edition in 20121. It will be colocated with ACL 2022 in Dublin , Ireland, as a hybrid event. The workshop dates are not yet fixed but will be on May 26-28, or possibly both dates. This year, LChange will feature a shared task on semantic change detection for Spanish as one track of the workshop. We hope to make this third edition another resounding success!</description>

      <guid>https://languagechange.org/events/2021-acl-lchange/</guid>
      <description>The workshop builds upon its first iteration in 2019, where we received over 50 submissions and had over 65 attendees. Just like the first one, the second LChange workshop will be co-located with ACL (2021), and, pending on the situation, a hybrid event with possible online participation. We hope to make our second edition another resounding success!
The call for papers will be similar to last time: all aspects around computational approaches to historical language change with the focus on digital text corpora.</description>

      <title>Turing workshop on automatic methods for lexical semantic change</title>
      <link>https://languagechange.org/events/2019-turing-lcworkshop/</link>

      <description>Words change their meaning over time, depending on a range of linguistic and extra-linguistic factors. Associating a word’s correct meaning in its historical context is a central challenge in diachronic research, and is relevant to a range of computational linguistics tasks, including information retrieval and semantic search on historical texts. In recent years, computational linguistics research has made great advances in the area of automatic detection of lexical semantic change, using a range of approaches varying from topic models to neural word embeddings.</description>

      <description>Languages change with time. While the study of meaning is not a new thing, the past few years have seen a lot of attention given to the computational tackling of particular tasks within (historical) semantics. Advances in NLP and the availability of massive textual corpora have made possible new research methods focused on lexical semantic change, using a range of approaches varying from topic models to neural word embeddings. Knowing what a word means at a particular moment of time is crucial for text-based research in the humanities.</description>

      <title>Wp2: Semantic Change Detection</title>

      <description>A rich tradition of cross-linguistic, detailed studies in lexical semantics has generated hypotheses that are ripe for further quantitative exploration made possible by the outcomes of this project. For example, synchronically: there are cognitively different kinds of temperature sensations, which form overt or covert sub-senses (Koptjevskaja-Tamm, 2015), that may be handled by different grammatical constructions (Pustet, 2015). Diachronically: word senses often go from describing external reality to internal perception (Traugott and Dasher, 2002); change often proceeds from a higher sensory modality to a lower (Viberg, 1980); perception verbs develop into cognitive verbs (Sweetser, 1991); or the exact hues denoted by Swedish color terms may change in a predictable fashion over time (Vejdemo, 2017).</description>

      <title>Wp3: Lexical Replacement</title>
      <link>https://languagechange.org/wps/lexical-replacement/</link>

      <guid>https://languagechange.org/wps/lexical-replacement/</guid>
      <description>There are several impressive taxonomies that lists types of lexical replacement processes (Ullman, 1957), but these are mainly descriptive and make little attempt to predict what kind of lexical change might happen for a given concept. Some proposed general hypotheses are that nouns are replaced more readily than verbs, that more frequent words are insulated from replacement (Pagel et al., 2007) and that rich synonym networks speed up replacement (Vejdemo and Hörberg, 2016), hypotheses that we can investigate using quantitative approaches on large scale, diachronic text upon completion of this project.</description>
